                                             Refactoring for accessibilty

This project was undertaken as a learning exercise. The purpose was to simulate a common on-the-job assignment--refactoring. In this case, the existing code was to be modified so as to increase accessibility. Improvements in accessibility can sometimes be complex, but in this instance they were intentionally kept simple. The benefits of such refactoring to business include assisting one's clients, improving SEO rankings, and avoiding litigation.
